Though some may like to think that science is done in isolation from society, the true nature of science is that it is constantly impacted by both larger social atmospheres and also political and economic movements. In other words, science is not isolated from society — society informs science and shapes it. After all, scientists are also everyday people, people who have both flaws and strengths. Notably, Kuhn’s significant text, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, discusses [[18]](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entrieshomas-kuhn/) how “the development of science is driven, in normal periods of science, by adherence to what Kuhn called a ‘paradigm’. The functions of a paradigm are to supply puzzles for scientists to solve and to provide the tools for their solution.” Kuhn’s words [103] on “paradigm shifts” in science have been exceptionally important, informing science as a whole (in addition to his entire project); Kuhn thought [[182]](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Kuhn-Paradigm.html) that scientific revolutions occur whenever a new paradigm as a result of a paradigm shift better explains observations, and offers a more objective, reality-based model. One notable example of such a paradigm shift is the shift from Lamarckian ideas to Darwinian ones, which overturned the previous paradigm of transmutation and inherited characteristics as per Lamarck in favor of Darwin’s theory on natural selection driving evolution. Indeed, Kuhn’s writing on scientific paradigm shifts was a paradigm shift in and of itself, one which informs the way we discuss science even today. Moreover, Kuhn also discussed how science is informed by society, and how the regular worries that come from a ‘non-science’ job are also very relevant to science as well — in other words, science is not [[127]](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions) a utopia, it is full of real human beings with different motives and desires. The artwork above [[28]](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/240723?position=159), “Allegory in Honor of the Roman College” shows a place of learning, the titular Roman College, and shows individuals talking and standing; much like a college is both a center for studious learning and discovery, while also being an innately human place where students and faculty make mistakes, learn from them, and grow, Kuhn’s writings also portray science as innately human. People in science quite often make mistakes experimentally, learn from these mistakes, and grow as researchers and as people to learn more. Moreover, the scientific article above [[15]](https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-018-0132-5) also shows how science is intrinsically human and is thus subject to shifts in paradigm and atmospheres — the paper explores socioeconomic gaps in science achievement, particularly during early schooling. Human factors impact the way science is both learned and taught, and these factors can significantly influence the way people interact with and understand science later on in life. Science is full of paradigm shifts, of old ideas and new ones cycling, of people making mistakes and learning, of discovery and advancement.
