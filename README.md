# Darwinism and (R)evolution: Paradigm Shifts and Science Through Time
## Welcome to my final project for GenEd 1004! This site will take you through many things: (1) A virtual art gallery, (2) a timeline of how science has changed throughout history, especially with respect to evolution and Darwin/Wallace's ideas, (3) how art and science are interrelated and an exploration of this scientific timeline through the eyes of art, (4) brief discussions of modern scientific papers that are related to the art pieces or events.
### To enter the VR Art Gallery, click the "VR Art" tab at the top, or click [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/another-page-science.html).

Artist's statement (read more [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/another-page-cs.html), too):

As someone interested in both science, history, and art, I wanted to create a project that could combine all of these interests. Especially with a topic like Darwinism, all three of these themes play a pretty substaintial role — many scientific processes are often influenced by history, and art is often a response to history. I considered many formats for this project, but felt a website would be the best psossible option. Why? Websites are quite easy to access — just type in a url! My project can be viewed by anyone, which will hopefully make it a useful tool for learning in the future. Moreover, the interactive elements that websites provide is pretty fun: clicking around a cool website (like this one!) and seeing what you can find and learn can be a enjoyable experience, and I hope you enjoy this project! Making a website for my project might be cool, but I wanted to take it even one step further by also having a VR Art Gallery component to my project as well. Not in Harvard Yard? No problem! All of the artwork used in my project is part of the Harvard Art Museums' collections, so hopefully it'll feel like you're back in Cambridge (besides the fun themed backgrounds for my VR gallery rooms, which you can read more about [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/another-page-art.html)) Moreover, to fully articulate my thoughts about the different scientific paradigm shifts in relation to Darwin's ideas through t
