# Darwinism and (R)evolution: Paradigm Shifts and Science Through Time
## Welcome to my final project for GenEd 1004! This site will take you through many things: (1) A virtual art gallery, (2) a timeline of how science has changed throughout history, especially with respect to evolution and Darwin/Wallace's ideas, (3) how art and science are interrelated and an exploration of this scientific timeline through the eyes of art, (4) brief discussions of modern scientific papers that are related to the art pieces or events.
