# Darwinism and (R)evolution: Paradigm Shifts and Science Through Time
## Welcome to my final project for GenEd 1004! This site will take you through many things: (1) A virtual art gallery, (2) a timeline of how science has changed throughout history, especially with respect to evolution and Darwin/Wallace's ideas, (3) how art and science are interrelated and an exploration of this scientific timeline through the eyes of art, (4) brief discussions of modern scientific papers that are related to the art pieces.
### To enter the VR Art Gallery, click the "VR Art" tab at the top, or click [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/another-page-science.html).

**I'm really interested in science and research! I love to learn new things and understand how and why things work!**

Writing and computer science are also things I like to explore, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot over the next four years and beyond. I also enjoy literature, art, and film. I'm also a big fan of the outdoors and exploring nature, and it was really cool to experience my first Boston snow this past fall!
