# List of time points and events with their direct mini paper/explanation hyperlinks
Please note: because this page is just the time points/events with the time points/evemts hyperlinked to their respective discussion pages themselves, the numeric citation hyperlinks in the brackets will not link to those specific source hyperlinks, but the numeric citations *still do indeed* map to the complete list of sources (my bibliography) found [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/sources.html). Additonally, the individual citation hyperlinks work on the "Timeline" page, which is [here](https://shanivi.github.io/paradigmshifts/another-page-cs.html). Thank you!
