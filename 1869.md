### Paper: [Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604008231)

Friedrich Miescher was a Swedish scientist who aimed to study cell chemistry. By recovering pus-filled bandages from local hospitals, bandages which were rich in white blood cells, Miescher analyzed these bandages and isolated a material which was very rich in phosphorus from the pus (white blood cell) cells. By doing this, he discovered nuclein, which others later on built upon. This was a significant paradigm shift — the quest to discover the basis of life was heating up, and Miescher’s discovery of nuclein even before the 1900s was an accomplishment, and represented a paradigm shift towards a now more molecularly-based science. The artwork above is very relevant to Miescher’s experimentation — the art piece is entitled “Alchemist’s Laboratory,” which is representative of a paradigm shift. Previously, before things like the scientific method or before system science was very widespread, alchemy was quite popular instead, with many alchemists studying things like transmutation. Now though, due to the previous paradigm shifts via events like Francis Bacon improving empirical science, a more modern era of science instead took hold. Miescher’s time saw the ushering in of a more molecular future era, an era where we are still attempting to make many more molecular discoveries. The scientific paper above does a great jo of summarizing the work that Miescher did to discover nuclein, and also adds more context to his discovery, as well, showing that a paradigm shift can be caused by just a curious mind willing to study some cells.
