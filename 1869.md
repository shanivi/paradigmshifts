### Paper: Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA [[38]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604008231)

Friedrich Miescher was a Swedish scientist who aimed to study cell chemistry. By recovering pus-filled bandages from local hospitals, bandages which were rich in white blood cells, Miescher analyzed these bandages and isolated a material which was very rich in phosphorus from the pus (white blood cell) cells. By doing this, he discovered nuclein, which others later on built upon. This [[[1]](https://www.genome.gov/25520232/online-education-kit-1869-dna-first-isolated) was a significant paradigm shift — the quest to discover the basis of life was heating up, and Miescher’s discovery of nuclein even before the 1900s was an accomplishment, and represented a paradigm shift [[193]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10739-020-09608-3) towards a now more molecularly-based science. The artwork above [[10]](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/241043?position=37) is very relevant to Miescher’s experimentation — the art piece is entitled “Alchemist’s Laboratory,” which is representative of a paradigm shift. Previously, before things like the scientific method or before system science was very widespread, alchemy was quite popular [[6]](https://www.britannica.com/topic/alchemy) instead, with many alchemists studying things like transmutation. Now though, due to the previous paradigm shifts via events like Francis Bacon improving empirical science, a more modern era of science instead took hold. Miescher’s time saw the ushering in of a more molecular future era, an era where we are still attempting to make many more molecular discoveries. The scientific paper above [[38]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604008231) does a great job of summarizing the work that Miescher did to discover nuclein, and also adds more context to his discovery, as well, showing that a paradigm shift can be caused by just a curious mind willing to study some cells.
