# Timeline of events
 
My project is entitled "Darwinism and (R)evolution: Paradigm Shifts and Science Through Time" because I was fascinated by all of the different scientific dicoveries through time that we learned about in class. All of these discoveries, ideas, and theories were revolutionary in some way, and helped shift the paradigms of their respective times. Thanks to these various discovereies, people were able to see the world in a new or different light than before. Moreover, all of these ideas are also related to Darwin and Wallace's ideas in some way â€” whether these scientific discoveries/theories influenced the theory of evolution directly or were helpful to Darwin in writing his monumental book, all of these ideas are related to evolution (and GenEd 1004).
